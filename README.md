# "Before You Buy" website

This project is a collaboration between 3 people in an effort to create a site that aids gamers in making purchase decisions. The site is designed to give you an overview of a few of todayâ€™s popular games by providing a descriptions, Metascores, and GameSpot review highlights.

## User story:
```
AS A prospective video game buyer
I WANT information on some games that I am interested in playing 
SO THAT I don't waste my time or money on games I wouldn't enjoy.
```

## Development

We sourced our data from the following APIs:
- RAWG.io: https://rawg.io/apidocs
- GameSpot.com: https://www.gamespot.com/api/

In terms of future development, we'd like to implement a search feature so that the user isn't restricted to our predefined list. We would also like our top 5 picks to be generated from realtime trends. Finally, we'd like to include pricing/sales information and links through which users could purchase the game.
